# From Assessment to Action: Introducing POAM Management to the SPRS Calculator

For Defense Industrial Base (DIB) contractors, the road to compliance is rarely a straight line. It is a cycle of assessment, remediation, and reassessment.

I am thrilled to announce a major update to the application: Integrated POAM (Plan of Action and Milestones) Management.

The Problem with Spreadsheets
Historically, managing a Plan of Action and Milestones has been a manual, disjointed process. You might perform your self-assessment in one tool (or a PDF), calculate your score in another, and then manually type every failed control into a massive Excel spreadsheet to track remediation.

### Closing the Loop Between Assessment and Remediation
The new update aims to eliminate that friction. By building POAM management directly into the calculator, we are closing the loop between identifying a problem and tracking its solution.

Here is what is new in the latest build:

1. Auto-Generated POAM Items
There is no need to type out control failures manually anymore. As you go through your assessment and mark a control as "Not Met," the application instantly flags it. With a click, you can populate your POAM with the specific NIST 800-171 requirements that need attention.

2. Export-Ready Artifacts
When it is time to present your status to stakeholders or submit evidence, you can export a clean, compliant POAM artifact. This ensures your documentation looks professional and adheres to expected formats without the headache of formatting Excel cells.

3. Browser Session Saves
In addition to the POAM features, You can now save your calculator state directly to your browser session.

This means you can close the tab, come back later, and pick up right where you left off. Security is paramount, so we also added a dedicated "Clear Session" button, allowing you to wipe the data instantly when you are finished.

### Try It Out
This tool remains free to use to help the community navigate the complexities of CMMC and NIST 800-171. My goal is to save you hours of manual typing so you can focus on what actually matters: securing your environment.
