# Getting CMMC Certified for a Business: A Guide
The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) is a mandatory requirement for Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies that want to continue working on Department of Defense contracts. It ensures that businesses protect sensitive government data against cybersecurity threats by meeting required maturity levels of cybersecurity practices.

Certification deadlines are approaching, and all DoD contractors must achieve the appropriate CMMC level, typically Level 2, to handle Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) effectively. This involves implementing technical controls, policies, and undergoing a formal assessment by a certified third-party assessor.​

## How to Find Certified CCPs and CCAs in the Cyber AB Marketplace
Certified professionals play a vital role in helping businesses prepare for and achieve CMMC certification. The two key certifications are:

**Certified CMMC Professional (CCP):** These individuals can assist companies in readiness activities, gap analysis, and cybersecurity program development.

**Certified CMMC Assessor (CCA):** These professionals conduct the official assessments required for certification.

To find certified CCPs and CCAs, DIB contractors can use the [https://cyberab.org/Catalog](Cyber AB Marketplace) , the official directory of certified CMMC professionals and organizations. Here’s how:

- Visit the Cyber AB Marketplace website.

- Use the search filters to find CCPs or CCAs based on location, certification level, or organization.

- Review profiles, certifications, and contact details of available professionals.

- Reach out to certified individuals or organizations to discuss your CMMC certification needs.

This marketplace ensures that all listed assessors and professionals meet stringent qualification and ethical standards required by the CMMC Accreditation Body, giving confidence in their expertise.​

## Tips for Preparing for CMMC Certification
**Understand Your Required CMMC Level:** Determine which CMMC maturity level applies to your contracts (often Level 1 or 2).

**Conduct a Gap Analysis:** Use CCPs to assess your current cybersecurity posture compared to CMMC requirements.

**Develop and Implement Policies:** Establish needed policies, procedures, and technical safeguards to meet the controls.

**Train Staff:** Ensure your workforce understands cybersecurity best practices and their role in compliance.

**Maintain Documentation:** Keep thorough records to prove adherence during the audit.

**Schedule Your Assessment:** Coordinate with a CCA or Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization to conduct the formal audit.

## Benefits of Using Certified Professionals
Employing CCPs and CCAs offers these advantages:

**Expert Guidance:** They bring deep knowledge of CMMC requirements, reducing compliance risks.

**Efficiency:** Streamlines readiness and assessment processes, cutting time and effort.

**Credibility:** Certified professionals carry the DoD’s endorsement, ensuring recognized and trusted credentials.

**Ongoing Support:** Many CCPs offer advisory services to keep your security program up to date post-certification.

Leverage the expertise of certified CCPs and CCAs found in the Cyber AB Marketplace and your business can navigate the complexities of CMMC efficiently, meet compliance deadlines, and secure critical defense contracts.
