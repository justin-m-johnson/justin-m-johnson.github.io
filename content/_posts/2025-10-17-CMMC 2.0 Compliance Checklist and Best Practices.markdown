## CMMC 2.0 Compliance Checklist and Best Practices

Achieving and maintaining CMMC 2.0 compliance requires a clear, step-by-step approach. With the latest updates to the requirements and DoD contract clauses, contractors need to understand what’s expected and how to keep compliance in good standing. Here’s a straightforward checklist and some best practices every contractor should follow to succeed with CMMC 2.0 certification.

First, determine your required CMMC level. Review your DoD contract clauses carefully, some contracts require Level 1, which focuses on basic Federal Contract Information (FCI) protection, while others demand Level 2 (or in the future... Level 3) certification to protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) or highly sensitive data. Knowing your target level lets you focus your efforts effectively.

Next, perform a thorough gap assessment. Evaluate your current cybersecurity posture against the CMMC 2.0 practices required for your level. Identify missing controls, weaknesses in policies, or technology shortfalls. This step often involves mapping your existing controls to the NIST SP 800-171 framework (for Level 2 and above), since CMMC 2.0 aligns heavily with those federal cybersecurity standards. Reference the NIST SP 800-171A for how assessors will mark you on this. YOU HAVE TO HAVE "MET" ON ALL OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL IN ORDER TO PASS IT. I cannot stress that enough, if you fail a portion of the control, it will all be considered "NOT MET"

Once you understand what you need to fix, develop a remediation plan. Prioritize gaps that pose the highest risk and start addressing them systematically. This could include implementing multi-factor authentication, improving access controls, strengthening incident response plans, or patching vulnerabilities.

As you implement controls, ensure you document all policies, procedures, and processes. Documentation is critical; auditors want to see that controls aren’t just in place but managed consistently over time. Don’t skip this step... Well-maintained, up-to-date records make the difference between passing and failing an assessment.

With remediation underway, invest in ongoing training and awareness programs for all employees. Everyone in your organization should know their role in cybersecurity. Regular training reduces human error, which remains a major cause of breaches.

Next, set up continuous monitoring and vulnerability management processes. This will help you detect and respond to incidents quickly. Use automated tools to scan for weaknesses and monitor logs for suspicious activity. CMMC 2.0 emphasizes ongoing vigilance over one-time fixes.

## Preparing for your formal assessment
Before your formal assessment, conduct an internal pre-assessment or audit to verify readiness. This dry run helps catch last-minute issues and gauges how well your controls align with certification requirements. Also identify the key personnel in this process. Here you will identify a minimum of two personnel: The OSC (Organization Seeking Certification) Assessment Official and the OSC Point of Contact. The Assessment official is the person in your organization who will be considered the highest-ranking representative of your organization and will be responsible for leading, managing, and engaging with the CMMC 3rd Party Assessor Organization (C3PAO). The OSC Point of Contact serves as the daily liaison who interfaces with the C3PAO's assessment team. Hot Tip: this person does not need to be part of your organization and can be a third party consultant.

Then, coordinate your official CMMC assessment with an authorized C3PAO for Level 2 and Level 3 certifications. For Level 1, you can self-attest annually but always stay prepared for spot checks or audits (Read: Do not lie about this, you can get audited, and potentially face a False Claims Act)

## Post Certification
After certification, remember that maintaining compliance is an ongoing effort and not a “set it and forget it” deal. Update your controls and documentation as threats evolve and business processes change. Continue training new hires, patching systems promptly, and monitoring security regularly.

Finally, stay informed about contract clause updates and any changes to CMMC requirements or DoD guidance. Compliance isn’t just about passing one audit. It’s about staying ready, maintaining trust, and safeguarding critical defense information for the long haul.

Following this checklist and embracing these best practices puts you in a strong position to achieve CMMC certification and keep it, protecting your contracts and your organization’s reputation.
