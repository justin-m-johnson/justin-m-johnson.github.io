# It's the Great Culling Charlie Brown: The Great CMMC Correction: Why the "Three Assessments" Rule Never Really Left

If you're a defense contractor navigating the thicket of CMMC compliance, you know that the stability and competence of the assessor marketplace aren't just details, they become absolutely critical to your timeline and bottom line. A quiet but seismic shift in assessment requirements is now spreading like wildfire among CMMC practitioners. And the fun part is that this isn't just a minor technicality; it's the fuse on what many are predicting will be a major market correction for the CMMC environment as a whole... This may be a necessary but brutal "culling" of assessment organizations that could leave many ill-prepared organizations suddenly stranded (oh snap).

The root of this brewing storm is a widespread, and dangerously comfortable, misunderstanding about assessor qualifications, more specifically, a hands-on experience rule that much of the community prematurely declared dead.

## The Fatal Flaw: Mistaking a Badge for Battle-Tested Competence
For a significant period, the path to becoming a Certified CMMC Assessor (CCA) was clearly marked by an essential, and practical benchmark including documented participation in three full assessments. This requirement served as a vital, hands-on crucible, validating an individual's ability to translate theoretical knowledge into a live, high-stakes audit environment.

Then came the change. The Cyber AB, the organization tasked with credentialing CMMC professionals, relaxed this explicit prerequisite for the individual certification process. However, many believed that the experience hurdle had been eliminated entirely. The simplified, yet utterly false, conclusion was this: if an assessor could pass the exam and secure the coveted badge, they were automatically deemed ready to lead an official audit.

This assumption, however, is the hidden trap.

## The Hidden Trap: ISO 17020 Moves the Goalposts
Enter in the ISO audits... The experience requirement didn't vanish... it simply performed a crucial lateral shift. It migrated from being an individual's application prerequisite to becoming the organizational mandate of the assessment firm itself. (Pro Tip: The Cyber AB requirements for C3PAO status mandate ISO 17020.)

While the Cyber AB handles the individual credentials of the assessor pool, the C3PAO (the actual assessment firm) is governed by ISO 17020. This is the international gold standard for "inspection bodies," and it places the unambiguous burden of proving personnel competence squarely on the organization, not the badge holder.

An ISO 17020 auditor will not accept a "paper certification" as sufficient proof of quality. To maintain accreditation, the C3PAO must demonstrate that it has its own robust, internal quality assurance system to monitor, train, and independently validate that its assessors are genuinely qualified for the scope of work they perform.

In effect, the former "three assessments" benchmark has been surgically transformed. It is no longer an individual application hurdle, but a critical, non-negotiable quality assurance requirement for the C3PAO's internal operation.

## The Coming Correction: When the Auditors Start Cutting
The predicted "culling" isn't speculation but quite possibly a certainty scheduled for when ISO auditors begin their mandatory reviews of C3PAOs. 

Whoops...

Organizations that leveraged the relaxed individual rules to quickly bulk up their assessor roster with badge-holders who lack documented, supervised, practical experience are now on a collision course with non-compliance. A C3PAO cannot simply hire a newly certified individual and dispatch them into the field as a lead assessor. They must be able to produce irrefutable evidence that they have internally vetted, shadowed, monitored, and formally validated that assessor's work to the ISO 17020 standard.

Without this documented proof, these firms risk losing their C3PAO certification and, with it, their entire authority to conduct CMMC assessments. For many, this will be an existential event.

## What This Means for the Defense Industrial Base
For Organizations Seeking Certification (OSCs), this market contraction will undoubtedly present short-term pain. A sudden, necessary tightening of the C3PAO market will inevitably lead to fewer available assessment slots and longer wait times (Double Whammy).

Think of it like being the immune system of the CMMC ecosystem kicking in. As a positive, it ensures that when you finally schedule your assessment, the team evaluating your compliance and determining your access to DoD contracts has been rigorously verified. These assessors won't just for their ability to pass a multiple-choice test, but for their practical competence and real-world experience.

The sudden, cold realization spreading through the community is this: the bar for quality was never lowered. It was simply moved to a point where the consequences for assessment firms cutting corners are far more significant. The badge might get a newly minted assessor an interview, but it is the organizational adherence to documented, hands-on experience that will ultimately keep a C3PAO in business. The time for relying on paper credentials alone is over.

Winter is coming...
