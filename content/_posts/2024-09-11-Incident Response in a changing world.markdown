## Incident Response in a Changing World: Navigating the Complexities of Data Privacy

In today's digital age, data privacy is a top priority for organizations of all sizes and industries. As technology advances, our personal information is being collected, stored, and shared at an unprecedented rate. However, with this increased reliance on data comes a heightened risk of security breaches, unauthorized disclosures, and other data-related incidents.

## The Importance of Incident Response

In the face of these challenges, having a robust incident response program in place is more crucial than ever. A well-designed incident response plan can help organizations detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents quickly and effectively. This not only mitigates the risk of damage to your reputation but also helps prevent costly fines and penalties associated with non-compliance.

## Frameworks for Incident Response

Fortunately, there are many frameworks available that provide detailed guidance on each step in the incident response process. For example, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework offers a comprehensive blueprint for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents. This framework can be referenced or reused by organizations to develop their own incident response plans.

Similarly, the NIST Privacy Framework explicitly references these functions from the Cybersecurity Framework to use in designing privacy incident response processes. While privacy incidents are not always the same as cybersecurity incidents, having a separate framework for handling privacy-related issues is essential.

## The Intersection of Data Breaches and Compliance

When managing an incident, legal processes often come into play. Most often, a data breach triggers compliance obligations if it constitutes a data breach. In this context, breach is a legal term that may be defined differently in different jurisdictions. Typically, a breach occurs when there is an unauthorized disclosure of private information.

Whether or not a disclosure is considered a breach depends on factors like the definition of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in each jurisdiction, the definition of an unauthorized disclosure, whether and how the PII was encrypted, and other specific elements that define a breach in a given regulation. A breach in one state or country might not be considered a breach in another, so where the data is stored can impact when a breach is declared.

## The Role of Compliance Obligations

When a breach occurs, compliance obligations most often include requirements to notify affected individuals and/or government agencies. Regulations vary in terms of how quickly an organization must make the notification, the method of delivering the notification, and exactly what such a notification must contain.

Privacy managers must have procedures in place to stay abreast of all applicable breach notification laws as well as capabilities to deliver required notifications. This may involve collaborating with legal counsel to determine jurisdictional requirements and deliver notifications. Remember that communications between the privacy manager and legal counsel are considered privileged and are not subject to discovery requests.

# Incident Response Procedures: More Than Just Documentation

It is critical to have all incident response processes, including legal and compliance steps, well-established before an incident occurs. For this reason, incident response procedures should rely not only on documentation and training but also on regular practice drills.

Tabletop exercises are popular methods of practice because they are relatively easy to conduct. Tabletop drills usually involve gathering all the relevant people and talking through a sample incident scenario. More intensive drills may simulate an incident by asking employees to role-play through a training incident in real time as if it was happening.

## Remediation Oversight: Evaluating Incidents and Implementing Remediations

Problems inevitably arise, and some incidents rise to the level of a breach, whereas others may only be internal compliance lapses that occur when employees fail to follow the procedures outlined by the privacy program. No matter the severity, the privacy program should include processes for evaluating incidents after they are resolved and implementing remediations to reduce the risk that such an incident might reoccur.

Remediations may range from simple steps to improve compliance with employee training requirements to an overhaul of network security technologies. The privacy program should assign clear responsibilities for handling remediations and establish a detailed procedure for documenting, implementing, and assessing such remediations over time.

# Handling Inquiries and Complaints: A Critical Component of Incident Response

Well-designed privacy programs include a process for handling privacy complaints. This feature is identified in the NIST Privacy Framework as part of the Govern function. Specifically, the NIST framework suggests that "Policies, processes, and procedures for receiving, tracking, and responding to complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals about organizational privacy practices are established and in place."

For most organizations, the ability to receive privacy complaints involves establishing a confidential way for individuals, including employees, to report complaints without fear of retaliation. This often takes the form of a confidential complaint hotline or online complaint form.

In conclusion, incident response is a critical component of any organization's data privacy program. By having a robust incident response plan in place, organizations can detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents quickly and effectively. Whether it's navigating the complexities of data breaches, compliance obligations, or remediation oversight, having a well-designed incident response program can help mitigate the risk of damage to your reputation and prevent costly fines and penalties.

### Takeaways:

* Develop a comprehensive incident response plan using frameworks like NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST Privacy Framework.
* Establish clear policies and procedures for handling data breaches, compliance obligations, and remediation oversight.
* Conduct regular practice drills, including tabletop exercises and more intensive role-playing scenarios.
* Assign clear responsibilities for handling remediations and establish a detailed procedure for documenting, implementing, and assessing such remediations over time.
* Develop a process for handling privacy complaints in a confidential and secure manner.

By following these guidelines, organizations can ensure that they are prepared to respond effectively to security incidents and maintain the trust of their customers, employees, and partners.
